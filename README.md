# Lunar-New-Year-Recognition-App
Recognizes Lunar New Year-related images using a machine learning model trained on thousands of images through a React Native app

Wanted to make an app using machine learning to recognize images, due to hype in the industry (Chat GPT, Bard, Github Copilot, Open AI, etc.)
Developed interest in Lunar New Year festival through Chinese classes and school opportunities
Intrigued by the special meaning behind each tradition/activity in festival
Merged passion for computer science and machine learning with appreciation for Lunar New Year
Designed an app for users to learn about the festival by taking pictures of items/activities on their phone

Here is a video explaining the creation of the app: [https://drive.google.com/file/d/1rV-AEXMq2a0YiTVs3bsaGjiPCAoT6hrU/view?resourcekey](url)
